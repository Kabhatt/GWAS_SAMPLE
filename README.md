# DYSF Gene Analysis Pipeline

This project is focused on analyzing the DYSF gene (GeneID: 8291) located on chromosome 2 of *Homo sapiens*. The pipeline processes genomic data in FASTA format and includes a data report file.

## Project Overview

This bioinformatics pipeline provides the following capabilities:

- Processing and analysis of genomic nucleotide sequences.
- Generation of data reports based on the provided genomic data.

## Files Included

- **gene.fna**: A FASTA file containing the nucleotide sequences for the DYSF gene.
- **data_report.jsonl**: A JSON Lines format file containing metadata and analysis results related to the gene.

## Pipeline Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the `gene.fna` file for further analysis.
2. **Analysis**: Perform sequence analysis, including alignment, variant calling, or other relevant genomic analyses.
3. **Report Generation**: Utilize the `data_report.jsonl` to generate insights and summaries of the data.

## Requirements

To run the pipeline, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Bioinformatics libraries (e.g., Biopython)
- JSON processing tools

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dysf-gene-analysis.git
   cd dysf-gene-analysis
